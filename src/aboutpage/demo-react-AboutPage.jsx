			   <b>Main functionality of Users</b>
			   <ul>
			    <li>Users are able to register an account and after verify the email, the users will be able to login to the system</li>
			    <li>After a successfully login the users can update own profiles</li>
			    <li>The users can receive new passwords by the forgot password functionality by reseting their password before a given time like 24 hours</li>
			   </ul>
			  
			   <b>Main functionality of Administrators</b>
			   <ul>
			    <li>Administrators have access to the same functionality as the users</li>
			    <li>In addition Administrators are able to list, create, update and delete the users</li>
			   </ul>
			
               <b>Technology used for implementing authentication and security</b>        
               <ul>
             	 <li>The Passwords of the users and administrators are encrypted by BCRYPT before stored in the database</li>
                 <li>The system is using a JSON Web Token ( JWT ) for access to the secure endpoints of the Web API after a successfully authentication</li>
				 <li>Authentication is implemented JWT access tokens ( expires after 15 minutes for testing ). Then the User will need to log in again</li> 
				 <li>The User is able to stay logged if / when using Refresh the page by the Browser. The localStorage is used as well by this React client for making more logic!</li>
				<li>The Web API is secured by CORS allowing only the subdomain containing the React SPA client making HTTPS request</li>
				 <li>Frontend validation</li>
				 <li>Joi Schema for backend validation to controle form input by removing whitespaces, 
					 allowing only limited length of input, letters and numbers only ...</li>
                 <li>The above security is making the Web API and the data secure for the users of the system</li>
               </ul>
